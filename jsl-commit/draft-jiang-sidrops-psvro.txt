Problem Statement and Requirements for Enhanced Route Origin Validation
                     Using Multi-Source Information
                    draft-jiang-sidrops-psvro-latest

Abstract

   Prefix hijacking has emerged as a major security threat in the Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP), garnering widespread attention.  To mitigate
   such attacks, Internet Routing Registries (IRR) and Resource Public
   Key Infrastructure (RPKI) have been developed, providing reliable
   mappings of IP prefixes to authorized Autonomous Systems (ASes).
   Nonetheless, challenges persist due to outdated Route objects within
   IRR and the limited deployment rates of RPKI.  Recently, several
   organizations have adopted the approach of integrating IRR, RPKI, and
   local data to enhance the quality of routing source data.  This
   document describes problem statement and requirements for enhanced
   route origin validation using multi-source information.

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is widely used for inter-domain
   routing in the Internet.  However, due to the lack of built-in
   routing security mechanisms, BGP is vulnerable to various security
   threats such as prefix hijacking.  To mitigate such attacks, the
   global Internet infrastructure needs to create a database to record
   the mapping of IP prefixes to authorized origin ASes, which can be
   used to determine whether BGP announcements are propagated or
   discarded.

   Currently, network operators primarily rely on Internet Routing
   Registry (IRR) and Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)[RFC6480]
   as data sources for route validation.  However, IRR suffers from a
   lack of effective validation mechanisms and incentives for resource
   holders to update objects, leading to the prevalence of outdated
   objects.  On the other hand, RPKI faces challenges in terms of
   complex operations, the negative impact of misissued ROA, and the
   certificate dependencies in the hierarchy of RPKI, which hinder its
   widespread deployment.

   To fully leverage existing data sources and improve the accuracy of
   route validation, enhance the robustness and security of the global
   routing system.  Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS)
   have advocated for the simultaneous use of IRR and RPKI,
   incorporating them into relevant actions for network operators.
   Currently, some organizations are attempting to filter outdated
   objects by implementing specific rules, such as JPIRR removing IRR
   objects that have not been updated within a given timeframe.
   Additionally, certain organizations and software, like RIPE NCC and
   Irrd v4, employ RPKI to filter out IRR objects that fail RPKI
   validation.  Moreover, research efforts, such as the introduction of
   algorithms like [IRRedicator], aim to filter IRR objects effectively.
   On the other hand, mechanisms like SLURM allow ISPs to establish a
   local RPKI view by enabling local filtering and additions based on
   specific requirements.

   This document aims to provide insights and recommendations to network
   operators, researchers, and policymakers for improving the security
   and robustness of the global routing system by analyzing the issues
   and challenges associated with route origin validation, particularly
   the integration of multi-source information.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Problem Statement

2.1.  Integrity and Accuracy of Route Origin

   As more ISPs participate in route origin databases, the coverage of
   address space by these databases has gradually increased.  As of
   February 2024, the RADB database has the highest IPv4 address space
   coverage, reaching up to 42%. In contrast, the NESTEGG database only
   has four Route object data.  However, the IPv4 address space coverage
   of RPKI is only 35%. Therefore, relying solely on a single IRR or
   RPKI database for route filtering and validation is insufficient due
   to the limited address space coverage.

   There are significant differences in the update activity of Route
   objects among active IRR databases.  Some databases maintain a high
   level of update activity, with recent updates occurring within the
   past year, such as LACNIC, JPIRR, and RADB.  On the other hand, there
   are databases that have seen little to no updates to Route objects in
   the past five years, such as WCGDB, NESTEGG, PANIX, and REACH.  The
   remaining databases also contain a significant number of Route
   objects that have not been updated in the short term.  This situation
   leads to a large amount of outdated and stale Route objects, which
   affects the reliability of the data sources.

   According to measurements from [IRRegularities], Route objects from
   JPIRR, RIPE, ARIN, ALTDB, and LACNIC have overlap rates in recent BGP
   announcements exceeding 60%, while databases such as APNIC, NTTCOM,
   WCGDB, PANIX, and ARIN-NA have rates below 20%. This indicates that
   some databases have lower activity and may contain a higher
   proportion of outdated data.  The RADB database, which has the
   highest address space coverage, has 29.8% of its Route objects
   appearing in BGP announcements.

2.2.  Lack of Support for MOAS

   [RFC1930] suggests that a prefix should only have a single AS as its
   origin with a few exceptions.  However, according to routing data
   from Routeviews[CAIDA], MOAS (Multi-origin ASes) has been a common
   phenomenon.  MOAS can arise due to reasons such as multi-homing,
   Internet exchange points, and multinational companies, as well as due
   to misconfigurations or prefix hijacking.

   Analyzing the MOAS state, as of 2024, the currently active IRR
   databases can provide complete coverage for only 31% of IPv4 MOAS and
   4% of IPv6 MOAS.  The RPKI database can provide complete coverage for
   26% of IPv4 MOAS and 3.55% of IPv6 MOAS.  Differentiating between
   legitimate MOAS and those caused by misconfigurations or route
   hijacking poses a significant challenge for existing route origin
   databases.

   Legitimate MOAS is primarily caused by factors such as multinational
   companies and multi-homing.  However, the current authoritative IRR
   and RPKI databases typically only allow registration of address
   blocks managed by the respective RIR.  This poses a significant
   obstacle to supporting legitimate MOAS.  On the other hand,
   misconfigurations usually occur within the same ISP, i.e., the ISP
   has multiple ASNs and IP prefixes, resulting from confusion during
   the configuration/update process.  These cases can bypass the current
   validation mechanisms.

2.3.  Inconsistency Among Multiple Sources

   As analyzed in section 2.1, relying on a single source of route
   origin database is insufficient for data validation.  However, by
   integrating multiple active IRR databases, the IPv4 address coverage
   can reach 67%. Further combining the RPKI database, the IPv4 address
   coverage can reach 70%, covering a significant portion of available
   addresses.  Moreover, In addition, the number of ASes participating
   in IRR or RPKI accounted for 86.5% of the total number of assigned
   ASes.

   Leveraging multiple sources of information can effectively improve
   the coverage of routing data for Internet numbering resources.
   However, according to recent measurement[IRRegularities], there are
   inconsistencies among the Route object across different IRR
   databases.  This may be due to chronic neglect on the part of the IRR
   customers, resulting in outdated and stale Route objects.  For
   instance, the company register route objects in multiple IRR
   databases, but it often updates Route objects in only a subset of
   those IRR databases, while neglecting the others.

   Further analysis of the consistency between IRR Route objects and
   RPKI reveals that as of February 2024, the IRR databases maintained
   by the five RIRs, as well as JPIRR, IDNIC, and other IRR databases
   maintained by Local Internet Registries (LIRs), exhibit a higher
   level of consistency with RPKI.  On the other hand, IRR databases
   maintained by third parties such as RADB, TC, and NTTCOM show lower
   levels of consistency with RPKI, with ineffective RPKI validation.
   Other IRR databases show significant differences with RPKI, such as
   PANIX, BELL, REACH, WCGDB, primarily manifested as low route object
   overlap and high route validation ineffectiveness.  Considering that
   RPKI contains the validation mechanism and each object has validity
   period, IRR databases that are inconsistent with RPKI may exhibit
   significant discrepancies.

3.  Requirements

3.1.  Verifiability of Route Origin Data

   Several Internet registries have attempted to address the issue of
   outdated objects in their IRR databases by implementing filtering
   rules.  For example, JPIRR removes IRR objects that have not been
   updated within a specified period, typically one year.  While simple
   rule-based validation can partially improve data quality of current
   routing origin, more innovative mechanisms are needed for
   intentionally malicious prefix hijacking.

   There is a requirement for verifiable route origin sources to enhance
   data quality and instill confidence in network operators when using
   these data for validation.  Additionally, it is important to leverage
   the collective oversight of the Internet community by providing a
   mechanism for customers to provide negative feedback, allowing the
   filtering of relevant outdated and stale data.  This will improve the
   current reliance on resource holders for resource registration and
   further enhance the availability of route origin data for validation.

3.2.  Fusion of Multiple Sources of Information

   To improve the accuracy of route origin, many organizations currently
   disable IRR Route objects using authoritative RPKI or local sources.
   These solutions contribute to enhancing data reliability and provide
   customized services to some extent.

   For certain requirements such as Multi-homing and multinational
   companies (MOAS), the introduction of multidimensional and multi-
   source information, such as commercial relationships, geographic
   relationships, and adjacency relationships, can further assist in
   source information validation.  Additionally, as the Internet is a
   network maintained by multiple networks, the quality of route origins
   can be advanced through consensus and collaboration, utilizing the
   privately maintained data of each network.

3.3.  Automated Updates

   The introduction of incremental update protocols such as
   RRDP[RFC8182] and NRTM[NRTMv4] reduces the interval for data source
   updates.  However, similar to mirror protocols, these protocols only
   synchronize data without performing validation, even if there may be
   differences with their own data.  To address revocation and update
   issues caused by the granularity of RPKI management, current
   solutions such as Minimal-ROA[RFC9319] have been proposed.

   During fusion of multiple sources of information and enhance route
   origin validation, preliminary verification of data can be performed
   while promoting automated incremental updates.  This ensures
   consistency of global route origin and automatically raises concerns
   about discrepant data.  Through multi-party consensus and
   negotiation, data accuracy and consistency can be advanced.
   Additionally, to ensure flexibility in data updates and revocations,
   efforts should be made to accelerate development of innovative route
   origin management, ensuring efficient and timely completion of
   relevant updates based on state changes.

3.4.  Multi-Party Collaboration Mechanism

   MANRS, through a community-based approach, aims to make the global
   routing infrastructure more robust and secure.  MANRS calls upon
   different roles within the Internet community to take corresponding
   actions and promote multi-party collaboration.  While MANRS proposes
   and advocates for multi-party collaboration, the actual
   implementation still relies on individual optimization of respective
   data, with monitoring of individual execution using the MANRS
   OBSERVATORY metrics, but lacks effective communication and
   collaboration mechanisms between parties.

   To ensure the reliability of route origin data, the introduction of
   an automated multi-party collaboration mechanism is necessary.  This
   mechanism should maintain multi-party consensus and a globally
   consistent view of route origin validation, serving as the basis for
   relevant route origin validation.  Additionally, this collaboration
   mechanism should fully consider the deployment benefits during
   partial or incremental deployment stages, attracting more
   participants to join the automated multi-party collaboration
   framework.
