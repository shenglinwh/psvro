                    draft-jiang-sidrops-psvro-latest

Abstract

   Prefix hijacking, i.e., unauthorized announcement of a prefix, has
   emerged as a major security threat in the Border Gateway Protocol
   (BGP), garnering widespread attention.  To mitigate such attacks,
   Internet Routing Registries (IRRs) and Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RPKI) have been developed, providing mappings of IP
   prefixes to authorized Autonomous Systems (ASes).  Nonetheless,
   challenges persist due to the completeness and accuracy of the route
   origin information contained within IRRs and RPKI.  This document
   serves to outline the problem statement for current route origin
   registry system.

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is ubiquitously used for inter-
   domain routing.  However, it lacks built-in security validation on
   whether its UPDATE information are legitimate [RFC4272].  To mitigate
   security concerns related to prefix hijacking, i.e., unauthorized
   announcement of a prefix, resulting from the absence of security
   mechanisms, Internet Routing Registry (IRR) [RFC1786] and Resource
   Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480] were developed.  These
   mechanisms serve the purpose of documenting the mapping relationship
   between IP prefixes and their respective origin Autonomous Systems
   (ASes).

   However, IRR lacks standard validation mechanisms and fails to
   incentivize resource holders to update their objects, resulting in
   outdated and stale information.  Similarly, RPKI faces challenges
   arising from the complexity of operations and the hierarchical
   dependencies of certificates, limiting its widespread deployment.  To
   effectively combat improper or malicious BGP announcement and
   strengthen the resilience of the global routing infrastructure, it is
   crucial to establish a comprehensive and verifiability route origin
   registry system.

   This document aims to provide insights to network operators,
   researchers, and policymakers for improving the security and
   robustness of the global routing system.

3.  Working Definition of Route Origin Registry

   Route origin registry refers to a repository that records the mapping
   of IP prefixes to the ASes authorised to announce them.  Resource
   holders can register route origin mapping relationships in route
   origin registry by themselves or delegate to others.

   IRR and RPKI currently offer functionalities related to route origin
   registry.  Multiple IRRs, which have been in operation since 1995,
   serve as a globally distributed database for routing information.
   They record the binding relationship between IPs and Autonomous
   System Numbers (ASes) via Route(6) objects, which are defined by the
   Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL).

   On the other hand, the RPKI system, which was developed starting in
   2008 and began its deployment in 2011, provides a formally verifiable
   framework.  The RPKI system is based on resource certificates that
   extend the X.509 standard.  It records the mapping between IP
   prefixes and their authorised ASes via Route Origin Authorization
   (ROA) objects.  These ROA objects contain essential information such
   as the prefix, origin ASN, and MaxLength.

4.  Problem Statement

4.1.  Multi-origin ASes Analysis

   [RFC1930] suggests that a prefix should typically have a single
   Autonomous System (AS) as its origin, with a few exceptions.
   However, CAIDA's analysis on BGP routing data [CAIDA], reveals that
   Multi-origin ASes (MOAS) have become a common phenomenon.  There are
   various reasons that contribute to the emergence of MOAS prefixes:

   *  *_Multi-homing_*: When multi-homing occur without the use of BGP,
      it can result in MOAS conflicts.  Assuming there is a link between
      ASx and ASy, and the routing on that link is done using either
      static routing or an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) without the
      use of BGP.  From a BGP perspective, ASx is considered to have
      direct reachability to prefixes belonging to ASy.

   *  *_Aggregation_*: According to [RFC1930], aggregation could result
      in routes that end in AS sets.  Specifically, when the
      ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attributes of aggregation announcements are not
      specific, the origin AS may be lost, potentially leading to a
      prefix being originated from more than one AS.

   *  *_Business consideration_*: Companies often choose providers that
      offer high-speed and reliable data services to host their servers.
      For efficient resource allocation, a parent organization that owns
      a large chunk of IP addresses may divide its address space among
      one or more child organizations, which choose different providers
      and ask them to announce the same prefix.  Additionally, a multi-
      national company may advertise its prefix from multiple locations
      where it has offices.

   *  *_Traffic engineering_*: An organization may advertise
      reachability to its prefixes from multiple ASs it owns.

   *  *_Internet exchanges_*: Internet Exchanges (IX) prefixs can be
      directly reachable from all ASes at the exchange point.  Each AS
      at the exchange point could advertise the prefix as directly
      originated from that AS.

   *  *_Anycast_*: Anycast prefixes intended to originate from multiple
      ASes.  This approach is potentially employed by content
      distribution networks (CDNs) to redirect traffic to the nearest
      servers, ensuring speedy data delivery to their customers.

   *  *_Prefix hijacking and misconfigurations_*: Malicious AS may
      advertise prefixes belonging to another organization, with the
      intention of attracting its traffic.  Similarly, unwanted
      annoucements can occur due to misconfiguration.

   Distinguishing between prefix hijacking, misconfigurations, and
   legitimate MOAS can be a complex task.  The challenge arises from the
   resemblance of these behaviors, as they often display similar
   characteristics.  Moreover, accurately identifying and classifying
   these situations necessitates a route origin registry with high
   coverage and accuracy.

4.2.  Integrity of current Route Origin Registry

4.2.1.  Incompleteness of resource certification

   As mentioned in [RFC7682], the lack of certification and incentives
   for maintaining up-to-date data within IRRs leads to lower accuracy
   of the information.  While a few IRRs exhibit regular updates, others
   have low activity with many Route(6) objects remaining unchanged for
   several years.  Recent measurement [IRRegularities] reveals that IRRs
   with low update activity exhibit lower overlap with BGP announcements
   than those with high update activity.  This indicates that IRRs with
   lower activity may contain a higher proportion of outdated and stale
   Route(6) objects, thereby impacting the reliability of the route
   origin registry.

   RPKI is a hierarchical Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that binds
   Internet Number Resources (INRs) such as Autonomous System Numbers
   (ASNs) and IP addresses to public keys via certificates.  However,
   there is a risk of conflicts in INRs ownership when misconfiguration
   or malicious operations occur at the upper tier, resulting in
   multiple lower tiers being allocated the same INRs.  Additionally,
   the existence of legitimate MOAS necessitates the authorization of
   binding between a prefix with multiple ASes, further complicating the
   issue.  Balancing the protection of legitimate MOAS while minimizing
   conflicts in INRs allocation presents a challenging problem that
   requires innovative solutions.  Furthermore, it is worth noting that
   RPKI Relying Parties [RFC8897] have not yet standardized the process
   of constructing certificate chains and handling exceptions such as
   Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Manifests.  This lack of
   standardization has resulted in different views on the RPKI records
   by Relying Parties (RPs) who adopt different implementations.
   Consequently, ASes served by different RPs may have varying
   validation results for the same route announcement.

   Consequently, the absence of data validation and standardization in
   operations within the IRR or RPKI framework means that there is no
   guarantee of the accuracy of the data registered in any route origin
   registry.

4.2.2.  Security Risks from Partial Deployment

   As the adoption of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
   continues to grow, the number of address prefixes registered within
   RPKI is gradually increasing.  However, recent reports from the
   Number Resource Organization (NRO) indicate that the coverage of IP
   prefixes within ROA has been relatively low.  Notably, the protection
   rate of route origin validation (ROV), as measured by Mutually Agreed
   Norms for Routing Security (MANRS) [MANRS], is significantly lower
   than the coverage of ROAs.  Additionally, [IRRegularities] also notes
   a decreasing trend in IP Prefix coverage in certain IRRs.

   On the other hand, it becomes evident that currently active IRRs and
   RPKI offer limited coverage for MOAS, particularly in the case of
   IPv6.  Moreover, the existing authoritative IRRs (maintained by
   regional Internet registries) and RPKI typically only allow
   registration of address blocks for self-managed purposes, posing a
   significant obstacle in supporting many legitimate MOAS prefixes.

   Limited IP prefix coverage within the current route origin registry,
   especially for MOAS prefixes, hinders the complete validation of
   route announcements, significantly limiting the motivation for
   network operators to utilize route origin registration.

4.3.  Operation of Resources among IRRs and RPKI

4.3.1.  Inconsistency between different Route Origin Registries

   Based on the analysis presented in the previous sections, it is
   evident that relying solely on a single source of route origin
   registry is insufficient in route origin validation.  To address this
   issue effectively, it is recommended to integrate the RPKI and
   multiple active IRRs.  This integration would not only enhance the IP
   address space coverage and AS participation rate but also improve the
   accuracy of route origin registry.

   However, it is important to note that this fusion approach may
   encounter several limitations.  As highlighted in [IRRegularities],
   inconsistencies exist among the Route(6) objects across different
   IRRs.  This inconsistency can be attributed to the chronic neglect by
   IRR customers.  For instance, some companies may register Route(6)
   objects in some IRRs but fail to update them in all the route origin
   registries, resulting in outdated and stale Route(6) objects.
   Furthermore, it is observed that a higher number of IRRs exhibit
   lower consistency with RPKI.  In practice, different networks often
   use different data and methodologies to perform route validation and
   filtering, resulting in disparate outcome, especially when ROA and
   IRR data conflict with each other.

   As a result, while integrating the RPKI and multiple active IRRs can
   improve the effectiveness of route origin validation, it is essential
   to address the issues of inconsistencies between different route
   origin registries.

4.3.2.  Synchronization and Management

   The current practice in IRRs involves the use of the Near-Real-Time
   Mirroring (NRTM) protocol [NRTMv4] to replicate and synchronize
   Route(6) object from other IRRs.  Similarly, the RPKI system relies
   on the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP) [RFC8182] to synchronize
   and update data.  However, these network protocols exhibit several
   weaknesses that need to be addressed.

   *  The absence of a mechanism to notify other mirrors when updates
      occur results in synchronization delays and data inconsistency
      issues.  This can be problematic when timeliness and accuracy are
      crucial.

   *  The lack of validation of replicated data from mirrored sources in
      both IRRs and RPKIs is a significant concern.  This leaves room
      for potential inconsistencies and conflicts with the existing
      data, compromising the consistency of the route origin registry.

   *  The absence of application security mechanisms within these
      protocols is another area of vulnerability.  This lack of security
      measures exposes the system to potential threats (e.g., data
      integrity) and unauthorized access.

   On the other hand, some organizations employ authoritative RPKI or
   local data to disable IRR Route objects.  This approach, adopted by
   RIPE NCC and IRRdv4, utilizes RPKI to validate and filter IRR Route
   objects.  Although this approach can partially eliminate outdated
   information in IRRs, the problem of inconsistency persists due to the
   limited coverage of RPKI and the absence of effective mechanisms to
   resolve conflicting data between IRRs.  It is crucial to establish a
   effective communication mechanism among multiple route origin
   registry, enabling negotiation and cross-validation of conflicting or
   special-purpose route origin information.

4.4.  Summary

   Currently, Internet Routing Registries (IRRs) and Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RPKI) are the main sources for route origin
   registries.  As the Internet evolves, the occurrence of MOAS prefixes
   becomes more prevalent, which places increased demands on the route
   origin registry system.  However, these systems face challenges such
   as incomplete coverage, inaccurate data, as well as global
   inconsistency.

   To tackle these challenges, MANRS have been made to integrate
   multiple route origin registries simultaneously.  However, the
   existing synchronization protocols between these sources lack
   effective data validation, which impedes the ability to handle
   inconsistencies resulting from inaccurate data.

   Hence, it is imperative to continue striving towards the development
   of a verifiable route origin registry system that can effectively
   discern between prefix hijacking and legitimate MOAS, while ensuring
   a globally unified perspective on routing origins and maintaining a
   high level of resilience.
