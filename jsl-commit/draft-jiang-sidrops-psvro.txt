             Problem Statement for Verifiable Route Origin
                    draft-jiang-sidrops-psvro-latest

Abstract

   Prefix hijacking has emerged as a major security threat in the Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP), garnering widespread attention.  To mitigate
   such attacks, Internet Routing Registries (IRR) and Resource Public
   Key Infrastructure (RPKI) have been developed, providing reliable
   mappings of IP prefixes to authorized Autonomous Systems (ASes).
   Nonetheless, challenges persist due to outdated Route objects within
   IRR and the limited deployment rates of RPKI.  Recently, several
   organizations have adopted the approach of integrating IRR, RPKI, and
   local data to enhance the quality of route origin.  This document
   describes problem statement for verifiable route origin.

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is widely used for inter-domain
   route.  However, due to the lack of built-in routing security
   mechanisms, BGP is vulnerable to various security threats such as
   prefix hijacking[RFC7908].  To mitigate such attacks, the global
   Internet infrastructure needs to create a database to record the
   mapping of IP prefixes to authorized origin ASes, which can be used
   to determine whether BGP announcements are propagated or discarded.

   Currently, network operators primarily rely on Internet Routing
   Registry (IRR) and Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)[RFC6480]
   as route origin.  However, IRR suffers from a lack of effective
   validation mechanisms and incentives for resource holders to update
   objects, leading to the prevalence of outdated objects.  On the other
   hand, RPKI faces challenges in terms of complex operations, misissued
   ROA, and the certificate dependencies in the hierarchy of RPKI, which
   hinder its widespread deployment.

   This document aims to provide insights and recommendations to network
   operators, researchers, and policymakers for improving the security
   and robustness of the global routing system by analyzing the problems
   associated with route origin validation.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Integrity and Accuracy of Route Origin

3.1.  Integrity of Route Origin

   As the adoption of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
   increases, the number of address prefixes registered with RPKI
   gradually increases, but the address space covered by RPKI remains
   low percentage.  On the other hand according to [IRRegularities],
   there are some IRR databases with a decreasing trend in address space
   coverage with the emphasis on data accuracy, the coverage rate of IP
   address space coverage is low for each IRR database.  Therefore,
   relying solely on a single IRR or RPKI database for route filtering
   and validation is insufficient due to the limited address space
   coverage.  Meanwhile, [RPKIMeasurements] shows that the protection
   rate of route origin validation has been at a much lower percentage
   compared to routing source coverage.

3.2.  Accuracy of Route Origin

   With the exception of a few databases, most other IRR databases have
   a low update activity level.  There are databases whose Route objects
   have not been updated in the recent years.  According to measurements
   from [IRRegularities], Route objects from IRR databases with low
   update activity have lower overlap rates in recent BGP announcements
   than those with high activity.  This indicates that some databases
   have lower activity and may contain a higher proportion of outdated
   and stale Route objects, which affects the reliability of the data
   sources.

3.3.  Support for Multi-origin ASes

   [RFC1930] suggests that a prefix should only have a single AS as its
   origin with a few exceptions.  However, according to routing data
   from Routeviews[CAIDA], MOAS (Multi-origin ASes) has become a common
   phenomenon, which can be due to multi-homing, Internet exchange
   points, and multinational companies, as well as due to
   misconfigurations or prefix hijacking.  Analyzing the MOAS state, the
   currently active IRR databases can provide lower full coverage for
   MOAS, especially IPv6 MOAS.

   Besides, Legitimate MOAS is primarily caused by multinational
   companies and multi-homing.  However, the current authoritative IRR
   and RPKI databases typically only allow registration of address
   blocks managed by the respective RIR.  This poses a significant
   obstacle to support legitimate MOAS.  On the other hand,
   misconfigurations usually occur within the same ISP, i.e., the ISP
   has multiple ASNs and IP prefixes, resulting from confusion during
   the configuration/update Route or ROA objects.  These cases can
   bypass the current validation mechanisms.

4.  Limitations of Multi-source Fusion

   As analyzed in above section, relying on a single source of route
   origin database is insufficient for route origin validation.
   However, the IP address space coverage and the percentage of AS
   participation in route origin can be effectively improved by
   integrating RPKI database and multiple active IRR databases.

4.1.  Inconsistency Among Multiple Sources

   According to [IRRegularities], there are inconsistencies among the
   Route object across different IRR databases, which may be due to
   chronic neglect on IRR customers.  For instance, the company register
   Route objects in multiple IRR databases, but it updates Route objects
   in only a subset of those IRR databases, while neglecting the others,
   resulting in outdated and stale Route objects.  Futhermore, more IRR
   databases have lower consistency with RPKI.  Because RPKI contains
   the validation mechanism and each object has validity period, IRR
   databases that are inconsistent with RPKI may contains more stale
   Route objects.

4.2.  Rule-based Filtering

   To fully leverage existing sources and improve the accuracy of route
   origin validation, enhance the robustness and security of the global
   routing system.  Many suggestions and solutions have been
   proposed.Internet registries have attempted to address the issue of
   outdated objects in their IRR databases by implementing filtering
   rules.  For example, JPIRR removes IRR objects that have not been
   updated within a specified timeframe, typically one year.  While
   rule-based validation can partially improve quality of current
   routing origin, more innovative mechanisms are required for
   intentionally malicious prefix hijacking.

4.3.  Cross-validation between Multiple Sources

   To improve the accuracy of route origin, several organizations
   currently disable IRR Route objects using authoritative RPKI or local
   data.  RIPE NCC and IRRdv4 utilize RPKI (Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure) to validate and filter IRR Route objects.
   {IRRedicator} leverages machine learning algorithms to identify stale
   Route objects, aiming to enhance the consistency between IRR and
   RPKI.  SLURM[RFC8416] allow ISPs to establish a local RPKI view by
   enabling local filtering and additions based on specific
   requirements.

   Although, these solutions contribute to enhancing route origin
   reliability and provide customized services for route origin
   validation, data enhancement has not been performed globally in the
   routing system.

4.4.  Route Object Management and Synchronization

   The introduction of incremental update protocols such as
   RRDP[RFC8182] and NRTM[NRTMv4] reduces the interval for data source
   updates.  Besides, to address revocation and update issues caused by
   the granularity of RPKI management, current solutions such as
   Minimal-ROA[RFC9319] have been proposed.  However, these protocols
   only synchronize and manage route object without performing
   validation, even if there may be differences with their own data.

4.5.  Multi-Party Collaboration Mechanisms

   MANRS make the global routing infrastructure more robust and secure
   by community-based approach.  While MANRS proposes and advocates for
   multi-party collaboration, the actual implementation still relies on
   individual optimization of respective data, with monitoring of
   individual execution using the MANRS OBSERVATORY metrics, but lacks
   effective communication mechanisms between parties.
   Measurement[MANRS] shows, while not all MANRS members fully comply
   with all required actions, MANRS participants are more likely to
   implement routing security practices.  But, according to recent
   measurement[ROVDep], a large number of networks still do not fully
   deploy ROV or propagate illegitimate announcements of their
   customers.
