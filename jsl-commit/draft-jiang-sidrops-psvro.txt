             Problem Statement for Verifiable Route Origin
                    draft-jiang-sidrops-psvro-latest

Abstract

   Prefix hijacking has emerged as a major security threat in the Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP), garnering widespread attention.  To mitigate
   such attacks, Internet Routing Registries (IRR) and Resource Public
   Key Infrastructure (RPKI) have been developed, providing reliable
   mappings of IP prefixes to authorized Autonomous Systems (ASes).
   Nonetheless, challenges persist due to outdated Route objects within
   IRR and the limited deployment rates of RPKI.  This document serves
   to outline the current state and problem statement for verifiable
   route origin.

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is widely utilized for inter-domain
   routing.  However, its lack of built-in security mechanisms makes it
   vulnerable to various threats, such as prefix hijacking [RFC7908].
   To address this issue, the global Internet infrastructure needs to
   establish a database that records the mapping of IP prefixes to
   authorized origin Autonomous Systems (ASes).  This database would
   enable the verification of BGP announcements and facilitate the
   identification of unauthorized routing.

   Currently, network operators primarily rely on the Internet Routing
   Registry (IRR) and Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) for
   route origin validation.  However, IRR lacks effective validation
   mechanisms and fails to incentivize resource holders to update
   objects, resulting in outdated information.  Similarly, RPKI faces
   challenges related to complex operations, misissued Route Origin
   Authorizations (ROAs), and the hierarchical dependencies of
   certificates, limiting its widespread deployment.

   This document aims to provide insights and recommendations to network
   operators, researchers, and policymakers for improving the security
   and robustness of the global routing system by analyzing the problems
   associate dwith verifiable route origin, with a specific emphasis on
   the integration of multi-source data.

3.  Current State of Route Origin within RPKI and IRR

3.1.  Integrity and Accuracy of Route Origin

   As the adoption of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
   continues to grow, the number of address prefixes registered with
   RPKI is gradually increasing.  However, the coverage of address space
   within RPKI remains relatively low.  Relying solely on RPKI database
   for route filtering and validation is insufficient due to this
   limited address space coverage.

   Concurrently, the absence of duplicate and unauthorised checking by
   RPKI during the issuance of resource certificates has resulted in the
   inability to guarantee data accuracy within the ROA.  Furthermore,
   RPKI continues to face security risks, including those associated
   with centralised authorisation and the inconsistencies of relying
   parties.  Notably, the protection rate of route origin
   validation(ROV), as indicated by RoVista [RoVista], is significantly
   lower compared to route origin authorization(ROA) coverage.

   As mentioned in [RFC7682], the lack of certification and incentives
   for maintaining up-to-date data within Internet Routing Registry
   (IRR) database leads to lower accuracy and integrity of the
   information.  While a few databases exhibit regular updates, many
   others have low activity, with Route objects remaining unchanged for
   several years.  Recent measurement [IRRegularities] reveals that IRR
   databases with low update activity exhibit lower overlap rates in
   recent BGP announcements compared to those with higher activity.
   This indicates that databases with lower activity may contain a
   higher proportion of outdated and stale Route objects, thereby
   impacting the reliability of the data sources.  Additionally,
   [IRRegularities] also notes a decreasing trend in address space
   coverage in certain IRR databases, emphasizing the need to prioritize
   data accuracy.

   In summary, while the adoption of RPKI is growing, the limited
   coverage of address space within RPKI and the challenges associated
   with maintaining up-to-date data in IRR databases underscore the need
   for a comprehensive and accurate approach to route filtering and
   validation.  Efforts should focus on improving the accuracy,
   integrity, and coverage of data sources to ensure the reliability and
   security of the global routing infrastructure.

3.2.  Support for Multi-origin ASes

   [RFC1930] suggests that a prefix should typically have a single
   Autonomous System (AS) as its origin, with a few exceptions.
   However, analysis of routing data from Routeviews, conducted by CAIDA
   [CAIDA], reveals that Multi-origin ASes (MOAS) have become a common
   phenomenon.  This can be attributed to factors such as multi-homing,
   traffic engineering, multinational companies, as well as
   misconfigurations or prefix hijacking incidents.  When examining the
   MOAS state, it becomes evident that currently active IRR databases
   offer limited full coverage for MOAS, particularly in the case of
   IPv6 MOAS.

   Moreover, legitimate MOAS primarily arises from multinational
   companies and multi-homing scenarios.  However, the existing
   authoritative IRR (maintained by regional Internet registries) and
   RPKI databases typically only allow registration of address blocks
   for self-managed purposes.  This poses a significant obstacle in
   supporting legitimate MOAS.  On the other hand, misconfigurations
   often occur within the same Internet Service Provider (ISP) when they
   have multiple ASNs and IP prefixes.  These cases result from
   confusion during the configuration or updating of Route or Route
   Origin Authorization (ROA) objects, thereby bypassing the current
   validation mechanisms.

   The prevalence of MOAS in practice highlights the need for addressing
   the challenges associated with managing and supporting MOAS
   effectively.  This includes improving the coverage of MOAS in IRR and
   RPKI databases, accommodating legitimate instances of MOAS and
   addressing misconfigurations.

4.  Limitations of Multi-source Route Origin Fusion

4.1.  Inconsistency of Data within Multiple Sources

   Based on the analysis presented in the previous section, it is
   evident that relying solely on a single source of route origin
   database is insufficient and inaccuracies in route origin validation.
   To address this issue effectively, it is recommended to integrate the
   RPKI database and multiple active IRR databases.  This integration
   would not only enhance the IP address space coverage and AS
   participation rate but also improve the accuracy of route origin.

   However, it is important to note that this fusion approach may
   encounter several limitations.  As highlighted in [IRRegularities],
   inconsistencies exist among the Route objects across different IRR
   databases.  This inconsistency can be attributed to the chronic
   neglect of IRR customers.  For instance, some companies may register
   Route objects in multiple IRR databases but fail to update them in
   all the databases, resulting in outdated and stale Route objects.

   Furthermore, it is observed that a higher number of IRR databases
   exhibit lower consistency with RPKI.  Since RPKI incorporates a
   validation mechanism and each object has a validity period, IRR
   databases that are inconsistent with RPKI are more likely to contain
   stale Route objects.  In addition, some companies that facilitate ROV
   verification present discrepancies in their methodologies when ROVs
   and IRRs conflict, resulting in disparate outcomes when filtering
   routes.

   As a result, while integrating the RPKI database and multiple active
   IRR databases can improve the effectiveness of route origin
   validation, it is essential to address the issues of inconsistencies
   and outdated Route objects within the IRR databases.

4.2.  Cross-validation between Multiple Sources

   To fully capitalize on the existing route origin sources and enhance
   the accuracy of route origin validation, several suggestions and
   solutions have been proposed.  These initiatives aim to strengthen
   the robustness and security of the global routing system.  Here are
   some notable approaches:

   *  Internet registries have taken steps to address the issue of
      outdated objects in IRR databases by implementing filtering rules.
      For instance, JPIRR removes IRR objects that have not been updated
      within a specified timeframe, typically one year.

   *  Some organizations employ authoritative RPKI or local data to
      disable IRR Route objects.  This approach, adopted by RIPE NCC and
      IRRdv4, utilizes RPKI to validate and filter IRR Route objects.

   *  The [IRRedicator] solution leverages machine learning algorithms
      to identify stale Route objects.  Its goal is to enhance the
      consistency between IRR and RPKI, thus improving the overall
      accuracy of route origin validation.

   *  The use of SLURM [RFC8416] enables ISPs to establish a local RPKI
      view.  This allows for local filtering and additions based on
      specific requirements, contributing to a more tailored and
      optimized routing system.

   While rule-based validation can partially enhance the quality and
   reliability of current routing origins, it is important to
   acknowledge that inconsistencies and data inaccuracies persist, as
   highlighted in the recent measurements [IRRegularities].
   Additionally, optimizing methods in response to only partial
   utilization may result in inconsistent behavior of the global routing
   system for the same announcement.

4.3.  Management and Synchronization

   The current practice in IRRs involves the use of the Near-Real-Time
   Mirroring (NRTM) protocol [NRTMv4] to replicate and synchronize Route
   object from other IRRs.  Similarly, RPKIs rely on the RPKI Repository
   Delta Protocol (RRDP) [RFC8182] to synchronize and update data.
   However, these network protocols exhibit several weaknesses that need
   to be addressed.

   Firstly, the lack of validation of replicated data from mirrored
   sources in both IRRs and RPKIs is a significant concern.  This leaves
   room for potential inconsistencies and conflicts with the existing
   data, compromising the integrity of the system.  Secondly, the
   absence of application security mechanisms within these protocols is
   another area of vulnerability.  This lack of security measures
   exposes the system to potential threats and unauthorized access.
   Furthermore, the absence of a mechanism to notify other mirrors when
   updates occur results in synchronization delays and data
   inconsistency issues.  This can be problematic when timeliness and
   accuracy are crucial.

   On the other hand, to address revocation and update issues by coarse-
   grained management, alternative solutions such as Minimal-ROA
   [RFC9319] have been proposed.  While Minimal-ROA enhances coding
   efficiency and scalability by minimizing the use of the maxLength
   parameter, it falls short in supporting efficient incremental
   updates.  This limitation hampers the system's ability to efficiently
   handle and incorporate incremental changes.

4.4.  Multi-Party Collaboration

   Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS) is a community-
   based approach that aims to enhance the robustness and security of
   the global routing infrastructure.  While MANRS promotes multi-party
   collaboration, the actual implementation currently relies on
   individual optimization of respective data.  The monitoring of
   individual execution is facilitated through the use of MANRS
   OBSERVATORY metrics.  However, one area that requires improvement is
   the lack of effective communication mechanisms between participating
   parties.

   Recent measurements [MANRS] indicate that participants are more
   likely to implement routing security practices compared to non-
   participants.  Nevertheless, according to a recent measurement
   [ROVDep], a significant number of networks still do not fully deploy
   Route Origin Validation (ROV) or fail to propagate illegitimate
   announcements from their customers.

   To further enhance the effectiveness of collaboration, it is
   imperative to develop more robust, intelligent, and automated
   mechanisms.  These mechanisms can streamline communication and
   facilitate seamless collaboration between MANRS participants.
